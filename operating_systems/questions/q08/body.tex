\subsection*{} What are the 5 benefits of Threads?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
        \item \textbf{Responsiveness}: Threads enable faster responses by allowing tasks to run concurrently.
        \item \textbf{Resource Sharing}: Threads can share resources like memory within the same process, improving efficiency.
        \item \textbf{Economy}: Threads are more effective than processes, requiring fewer system resources.
        \item \textbf{Scalability}: Threads allow programs to scale across multiple processors, improving performance on multi-core systems.
        \item \textbf{Utilization of MP Architectures}: Threads maximize the utilization of multi-processor architectures by distributing workloads across available cores.
    \end{enumerate}
