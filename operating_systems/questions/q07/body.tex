        It is important for the scheduler to distinguish I/O-bound programs from CPU-bound programs because I/O-bound will spend most of their time waiting for I/O operations and thus only use the cpu for short bursts. Meanwhile, CPU-bound programs will require longer time on the CPU. By distinguishing between them, the scheduler can better optimize allocation of resources and improve efficiency.
